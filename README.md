# rsa-webcrypto-tool
This is a HTML/JavaScript tool that does RSA encryption, decryption, and key generation using the Web Crypto API. There are many other tools like this, but none I found are hosted on GitHub Pages, which offers transparency you can trust (if you trust GitHub). Also, I had trouble finding a web-based tool that performs asymmetric encryption on files.
